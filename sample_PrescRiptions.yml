# This is a prescRiptions.yml file. It allows configuration to be stored on a 
# machine without having to be shared with others. It is ideal for storing any
# configuration specific to your machine, which should not be shared
# with others. Every prescRiptions.yml file should be paired with a corresponding
# prescRiptions.yml.example file. That file should have no sensitive data in it, but give
# another developer an idea of how to replicate your local config.

# The contents of this file are read in with
# `PrescRiprions::readSettings("PrescRiprions.yml")`.
# It is then available to R as a list.
